**#Current Features (as of July 2025)**
    
    *Watchlist integration: Dynamically tracks and updates watchlist items. Notifies you of player injuries, status changes, or betting anomalies.
   
    *Live Odds Processing (in progress)Designed to pull live betting odds via API
  
    *Confidence Scoring SystemCalculates confidence level for a bet based on live and recent performance stats.
   
    *User-Defined Bet IncrementsGives you projected win amounts based on custom bet inputs ($20, $40, $60, etc.).
 
    *Voice-Optional Command InterfaceBot can talk to you and respond to natural language commands (GPT integration coming).
   
    *Underdog Value Detection (planned)Will analyze underdog picks by comparing injury reports, trends, and recent performance to detect betting advantages.
    
    *Injury Scraper (not fully functional yet)Actively being developed; built using Selenium to navigate complex div-based injury report pages.
   
    *Smart CSV Learning Loop (planned)Bot will learn from previously exported betting logic and apply it to future prediction


  
**#Planned Features**

	  MLB is prototype. Multi-sport expansion (NBA, NFL, WNBA) 
	  
	  GPT-4o configuration for logic and conversation (interface code is written)
	  
	  Push notifications or desktop alerts
	  
	  Clean front-end UI for non-technical users
	  
	  Browser-based version and/or mobile app export
	


**#Tech Stack:**

	  Python (3.11+)
	  
	  Selenium – Browser automation for scraping
	  
	  Requests – API and web data
	  
	   BeautifulSoup – HTML parsing
	  
	  python-dotenv – Secure key handling
	  
	  openai – GPT model integration (optional)
	  
	  mlb-statsapi – MLB stat queries



**#How it Works**
	
	  You input your watchlist or let the bot build it.
	  
	  Bot scrapes data on injuries and current stats.
	  
	  Odds and conditions are analyzed, and a confidence score is calculated.
	  
	  You ask it a question — optionally by voice — and it tells you what to bet.



**#Status**
  
	  This project is actively in development. Most modules are working, except for:
	  
	  The injury scraper, which is partially functional.
	  
	  Underdog logic, which is not yet coded.
	  
	  GPT logic w/ voice interface is being configured
